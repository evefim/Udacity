# Self-driving car specialization

## Project 1. Object detection in an Urban Environment
### Project overview
This project is devoted to study object detection techniques applicable to self-driving cars industry.
Namely it deals with detection of three type of objects: cars, pedestrians and cyclists in different environments: roads, highways, crossroads etc.
This task is very important for self-driving cars, because images taken by cameras (along with information fron lidars and radars) are the key means that provide automotive AI with the information needed to correctly identify the car position relative to other road objects. 

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.

#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
